# lagrange-interpolation

A polynomial interpolator based off of the method of Lagrange interpolation.

`values.txt` contains the number **n** of data points followed by **n** lines each consisting of an x-value, a space and a y-value.

In order to use the interpolator, insert the values in `values.txt` as specified, then build and run `Lagrange.java`. The resulting `result.html` file will contain the data points originally inputted, followed by the interpolated polynomial, formatted with Latex.
